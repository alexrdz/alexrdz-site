## Process

### Project Brief

nuestra salud needed a simple brochure site. they were explicit in their needs: 
- 1 page
- not complicated
- not a lot of design
- easy to read

there really wasn't much else to the brief. i was sent an email with all the content to appear on the site. 

### Design & Code

 i designed in the browser using [roots](http://roots.cx/), a static site generator that comes pre-equiped with [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) css pre-processor and [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templating. because we were dealing with one page and turn-around time was quick (i had 2 days to complete the project), the site was created live on their server with sign-off granted almost immediately. it was a very quick project with not a lot of content. but in the end, the client was happy with the result.
 
 i'm trying to get user feedback in hopes of showing the client the need for some fresh eyes and real user input. any feedback is always appreciated.
