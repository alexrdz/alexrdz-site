## Process

### Project Brief

this was a fun project but quite possibly the toughest client i could have. as you can probably guess, yes we are related. this site is a personal site for my wife, noreen naseem rodriguez. she is currently a PhD Candidate at UT Austin. the site serves as a repository for her work and writings as a graduate student and a continuing educator. she wanted an easy way to add information but more importantly, a way for others to access her work and all the information she has gathered. as an educator and future educator of educators (professor in education), it is important for her to provide helpful and useful resources to teachers and student teachers.

aside from being an educator, noreen is a talented artist and crafty as all hell. and after spending a lot of time searching and gathering materials online, viewing and reading through other scholars' websites, she knew exactly what she didn't want. and left me with quite possibly the most vague project brief of all time: 

> i want it to be professional, but not stodgy. and you know me... i like color!

### Interviews & Note-taking

i decided the best way to get at the core of her needs was to interview her. so i asked her a series of questions including:

- who will be looking at/using this site?
- what is the look and feel you are after? general terms are ok but i tried to dig a little deeper giving her examples like 'warm,' 'inviting,' 'fun,' etc. 
  - what will you look at or identify to determine your site is a success?

luckily, she unleashed after this question enabling me to identify different types of users as well as a direction in which to head.

### Wireframes & Sketches

getting noreen to participate in wireframing or provide feedback was a bit tough. but i managed to explain to her the direction we were headed and got sign-off on everything. not much feedback but in the end, her site and site needs are not complex.

several wireframe iterations and 3 days later i felt i was on the right track.

### Design & Code

using [sketch app](http://www.sketchapp.com/) i started working on a style tyle, definig a color palette, typography and small ui elements.

gaining favorable comments, i stepped right into the site design itself also with [sketch app](http://www.sketchapp.com/). i involved her as much as possible in the design process to make sure that all ui and color considerations were satisfactory and to get as much feedback as possible before i started writing the html + css.

### the final desing
