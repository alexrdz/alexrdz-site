## Process

### Project Brief

laredo examiners had zero budget and needed a serious update to their website. so with zero budget, i had to assess client needs, user needs and time constraints. i inquired about content updates and copy writing. i wanted to know how often the content would be updated and who would be doing the updates. surprisingly, content on the site had not been updated in a very long while and there were no plans to update it, now or in the future. 

also because there was no budget, user research and user needs unfortunately had to be placed on hold. i had no access to anyone on that side of the fence. so i asked one of the owners of laredo examiners to step into the shoes of the user. this was as close as we were going to get.

### Interviews & Note-taking

the exercise went well and we were able to get some valuable information. the most important piece of information i was able to get from the owner was that the information presented on the site can get lengthy and a bit overwhelming to read. so a clear presentation of information was paramount. 

i was not going to have more opportunities to sit down with the owner so we went through a quick wireframe exercise as well. i got sign-off and moved right over to design and code.

### Design & Code

because this site was to have no admin or frequent updates, i designed in the browser using [roots](http://roots.cx/), a static site generator that comes pre-equiped with [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) css pre-processor and [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templating. using [roots](http://roots.cx/) made it very easy to create, update and generate the site locally and ship up to their shared hosting account. it's a static html site so it's fast and ultimately, very secure.
