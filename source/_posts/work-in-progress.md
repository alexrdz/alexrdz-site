## this site is a perpetual work in progress...

this site is going to be changing a lot. that is my hope, anyway. reading blogs and articles around the web, it seems that most sites and apps launch as soon as possible and slowly make improvements. in years past, i wouldn't launch a site until it was "finished." but sites are rarely ever "finished." they're supposed to grow in content and function. so i knew that when i finally published this site i would continue enhancing it as my knowledge of modern web development practices grew. and this is how i planned my unfinished site:

### decide on look and feel for the site
there were two criteria for the look and feel of the site:

- nice, readable typography because i'm hoping to write as often as i can. 
- a small touch of my personally

the first was met with my font choices: [Varela Round (sans-serif)](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Varela+Round), bold and playful, for my headings and [Libre Baskerville (serif)](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Libre+Baskerville), an elegant and unsung serif, for body text.

adding some of my personality was easy enough. being a father is priority in my life and i wanted to reflect that. so i chose a picture of my girls and me. i am also a proud chicano and love my mexican heritage. so that's reflected in my new id/logo. 

### quick sketching and wireframing

i didn't spend too much time on the wireframing because i had a general idea of what i wanted and i knew it would more than likely change over time. so i did some simple sketches to have a concrete visual representation of the idea:

### design

since i knew my site would be simple and i also wanted to work on my front end chops, i skipped the use of design tools like sketch or photoshop and worked directly in the browser. 

### code
i tried a few new things on the build of the site. first i worked with [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), which i had been wanting to learn how to use. i've cloned other people's repos and run their 'gulp' tasks but i'd never written my own. it really wasn't very difficult. but i did invest $20 on a [gulp.js udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/rapid-gulp/) which is now $14 (dammit!). anyhow, it was a good investment. i managed to write several tasks to compile my [jade templates](http://jade-lang.com/) and [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) (my css preprocessor of choice), and one to set up live reload. i've yet to create a repo for that but i should have it up on github within the next few days.

initially, it was just going to be a portfolio site but i decided to try and keep a log of all the crap i'm learning, mostly for my own reference. so with that came the need for a blogging tool. i could easily set up a [processwire](http://processwire.com/) site (the absolute best cms around). but because i am on a mission to learn new things, i decided to try one of these static blog generator thingies all the cool kids are using now. 

### technology research
because i like using [jade templates](http://jade-lang.com/) and [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/), it was easy to narrow my search from the multitude of static blog engines. and it boiled down to [hexo](https://hexo.io). it's pretty easy for a novice developer to set up. and by easy i mean it took me about 8 hours over 2 days to set it up with my theme/templates/css. those 8 hours included reading, learning, and coding. i did do a little bit of ugly hacking to get it to do something i didn't know how to do easily or readily with the hexo api. but it works... and i hope later down the line to get rid of the ugly hacks and do it the developer way. i'll document those ugly hacks in a subsequent post dedicated to my hexo experience.

and so here is my site, perpetually a work in progress. if you have any comments, critiques, suggestions, etc., i'd love to hear them.
