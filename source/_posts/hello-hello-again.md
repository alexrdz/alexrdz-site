## learning web development. again.

i've been employed as a "front end developer" for about 8 years now. i use that term in quotes because that is essentially what i am to a very minor degree. see, i work at an organization that has one website running on drupal. for the past 4 years, my only job has been as a gatekeeper to the site's front end code. however, in that time, it was strictly a 'keep it as is' situation where no feature enhancements, facelifts or upgrades of any kind were condoned. so for 4 years, i sat at a desk and tweaked some css, jQuery or php templates from time to time. as a front end developer, i did no development, no design. mostly, i fixed views in drupal that somehow stopped working as. sidenote: drupal is fucking awful.

so 4 years later it dawned on me that i knew nothing. the web had passed me by. and worse, i had nothing to show for my last 8 years of employment. no portfolio. no github account with interesting or even lame projects. no apps i could i say i created or to which i contributed.

i felt like that for a long while but it wasn't until i realized that my situation at work was never going to change. but if my knowledge and understanding were going to develop, i needed to make a change somewhere. so i decided to start from the beginning as if i knew nothing. from CSS3 and HTML5 to javascript (the language itself, not jQuery the framework). 

i started to pore through tutorials online. from free resources to paid ones (books, online courses like udemy, etc).  and after having gone through all that, i realized i still didn't know much. i felt i needed 2 things:

a mentor/colleague/fellow developer of some sort. hopefully, someone with more knowledge than i have. but a novice like me would be great too. learning alone is not difficult. but learning with someone is much easier.
a hands-on experience of some sort. i took a couple online "build 12 apps"-type courses but that still wasn't enough.
i looked into bootcamps like iron yard, general assembly, and others. but most were full-time and all were very expensive. so i was lucky to find a bootcamp through UT Austin that was tailor-made for working people. and it was half the cost of most other programs. it was still pricey, but after some deliberation and discussions with the wife, we decided it was worth it. so i took out a loan and paid for the course.

this is where i am now.

i am currently starting the program in hopes that i can take my existing knowledge and that of the bootcamp to find a new job. i am anxious and very nervous about it. but it is time to face things [head-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGp47YwDZ48). and i am attempting to document my experience, my learning, frustrations, and any insights i may have. 

i feel like my life as a developer has been one of feeling like there is too much to learn, overwhelmed with the constant barrage of new technologies or frameworks, or otherwise unable to keep up.

i hope it helps me digest any new information i learn. and i hope it may be of help to anyone like me who is never confident in their skills.

if you also feel this way sometimes, maybe you and i can have some aha! moments and help each other along the way. and if you ever felt this way and are one of those badass developers out there, maybe you can remember what it felt like at some point and reach out to a junior developer in need of a nudge in the right direction. or just a little understanding.

but enough of the touchy-feely stuff. time to get moving.
